# Front-End Implementation Test

## Infomation

Please find the main project in the dist folder. The root folder contains all the build files (including sass and gulpfile) whereas the dist folder contains the final production version.
If you wish to build the project using the root files you will need to install gulp and the following depencies:

* gulp
* gulp-concat
* gulp-uglify
* gulp-rename
* gulp-sass
* gulp-sourcemaps
* del

You can install these with the following command:

`npm install gulp gulp-concat gulp-uglify gulp-rename gulp-sass gulp-sourcemaps del --save-dev`

Then build using `gulp build`
